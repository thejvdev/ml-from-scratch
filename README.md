# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository was created to deepen my understanding of machine learning methods by implementing them from scratch in Python Jupyter Notebooks and comparing their results with the models provided by existing libraries.

## Description

The notebooks are organized to demonstrate the step-by-step process of building and evaluating algorithms. They rely on a set of widely used Python libraries:

- **NumPy** – for vectorized and matrix operations, linear algebra, and numerical routines.
- **Pandas** – for structured data manipulation, preprocessing, and tabular analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for data visualization, including exploratory analysis and graphical representation of algorithm results.
- **Scikit-learn** – for access to datasets, utility functions, and baseline models for validation.

Each notebook typically includes:

1. **Math** – key formulas and theoretical background for the algorithm or evaluation metric.
2. **Implementation** – step-by-step Python code that reproduces the method without relying on high-level machine learning functions.
3. **Datasets** – description and links to datasets used in the experiments.
4. **Visualization** – plots illustrating the behavior of the algorithm, decision boundaries, performance metrics, or error analysis.
5. **Comparison** – evaluation of the custom implementation against Scikit-learn (or other libraries) to verify correctness and performance.
